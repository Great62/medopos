        Changes to your treatment plan. It may be necessary to adjust the date
        of treatment due to circumstances such as the need to treat trauma at
        the receiving hospital, which may delay your elective surgery or
        treatment. You are therefore strongly advised to book open tickets for
        travel which can be changed at short notice, to make adjustable
        arrangements for your absence (care of other family members, pets,
        security patrols, etc). Documentation requirements for travel are
        onerous, changeable and often country specific even in the EU, so you
        must ensure that you have all the correct documents for travel, not
        forgetting in-date vaccination certificates.
