        Compass Elective Heath will search and provide options for medical
        treatment abroad, bearing in mind the expressed preferences of the
        client. We will use out best efforts to obtain several (from two to
        many) quotations for specific medical treatment according to information
        provided to us concerning your medical history and condition, including
        your financial resources. Medical treatment costs vary widely so you may
        be unwilling to pay double the cost for two per cent extra quality of
        care or you may have personal reasons for your choice of medical
        provision which, if communicated to us in advance, we will make our best
        efforts to honour. We nevertheless reserve the right to refuse your
        custom if we feel that your choice is not in your best interests.
