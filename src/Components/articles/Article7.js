        Medical catastrophe. While extremely rare, some operations go very
        badly. You must agree that any claim for medical negligence must be
        heard in the country where the operation was conducted and that your
        claim is against the clinic / hospital / physician. In no case can
        Compass Elective Health be held responsible for having directed you, in
        good faith, to a clinic where you suffered any medical accident. You
        must also be forewarned that compensation claims in other countries
        nearly always result in lower monetary awards. These usually are limited
        to consequential loss without punitive damages. Claiming under another
        (home) jurisdiction may not be possible under the terms of the agreement
        you sign on arrival for your operation. In all events the liability of
        Compass Elective Health shall be formally limited to the fees received.
