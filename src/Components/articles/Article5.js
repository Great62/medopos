        Chronic medical complaints are often treatable. However, the ideal
        combination of freedom from pain, increased mobility, improved mood,
        desirable changes in appetite, more muscle and less fat, and regain of
        lost youth are not all available at once. You agree to observe the
        recommendations of the treating physician before travelling and after
        your operation. Post-operative treatments such as physiotherapy may not
        be available on the National Health and you are advised to budget for
        such necessities.
