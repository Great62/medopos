        Dispute resolution. In the event of any disagreement it is in the
        interests of all parties to attempt an amicable resolution before
        engaging expensive foreign national or international legal proceedings.
        We will assist in finding a compromise. A suggested first point of
        contact is the European Union dispute procedure which can be found at
        https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/?event=main.home.howitworks
        There are other services available. If all efforts fail we will supply
        any relevant records tp the court but will not attend, neither on behalf
        of one party or the other.
