        Cancellation. If you cancel within one month of your departure your
        medical fees may be forfeited. We will do our best to offer alternative
        dates or clinics but this may involve considerable extra cost. If the
        cancellation is ordered by the clinic your fees will be refunded, less
        your GBP200 deposit. Again, we will do our best to provide an
        alternative. In the case of force majeure – flight cancellation,
        industrial action, sickness of treating physician, plague, war, riot,
        fire, vulcanism, meteor strike, bankruptcy, civil commotion, Foreign
        Office advice, border closure, inclement weather, act of God or any
        event beyond our control – we will require a refund from the medical
        provider and forward this to you less our GBP200 deposit. Again, we will
        do our best to find an alternative. If you refuse all alternative
        options proposed no refund will be granted.
