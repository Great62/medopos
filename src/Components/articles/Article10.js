        Companions. We believe it is useful and important to have a friend,
        companion or family member to accompany you. We do not normally make
        arrangements for their convenience, though we may informally advise on
        hotels and aspects of local interest. The presence of a companion is
        important for reassurance and comfort, but it is not expected that he or
        she should engage in the duties of an auxiliary nurse.
